			<h1 class="center">Wow, we made it to 2021!</h1>
			<p class="center">
				We have a few things that helped us achieve this accomplishment. One of
				those things was Repl.it for pushing people onward in this time of COVID
				with cool code challenges and other things like collaborations and
				sponsorships on cool code programs like AOC. We've highlighted the best
				stuff from this year and gave a timeline of every announcement by
				repl.it<!--,
				and added a
				<a class="homeLink" href="/suggestions">suggestions page </a> in this
				website so we can give our feedback to repl.it. -->
				Thanks! We have a suggestions page, in which you can give suggestions to
				repl.it, which is not complete yet so for now if you are viewing this on
				GitHub create an issue of the suggestion for repl.it and if you are
				viewing this on repl.it write below a comment a suggestion for repl.it.
