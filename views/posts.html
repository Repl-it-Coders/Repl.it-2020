		<h3 class="center">A note</h3>
		<p class="center">
			This year was a sad year as we had many crises, but one thing to note is
			that because of Covid-19, repl.it gained many members to their community.
			Many people were bored cooped up inside and so they started coding. They
			found repl.it, and started using it as their IDE. People who were coding
			before too started coding even more and as a result this year we had many
			good projects shared on repl talk. I am saying this as when I was looking
			at the most upvoted posts this year, I found out that the number 6th most
			upvoted post ever was a post from this year, and it was released less than
			3 months ago. Even number 7 was very recent and many more. All the top 12
			most upvoted posts of this year were in the top 30 of the most upvoted
			posts of all time(with the 10th most upvoted being number 28). Thank you,
			repl.it community, for creating these awesome posts and thank you, repl.it
			creators, for making this awesome website. You,
			<a href="https://repl.it/@amasad">amasad</a>, and you,
			<a href="https://repl.it/@hayaodeh">hayaodeh</a>, are simply the best!!!
			<br /><br />
			Also, check out repl.it's version of this website, called loopback which
			shows all your stats of the year,
			<a href="https://replitloopback.repl.co/">here!</a> amasad's loopback is
			<a href="https://replitloopback.repl.co/amasad">this</a> and
			my(Whippingdot's) loopback is
			<a href="https://replitloopback.repl.co/Whippingdot">this!*</a>
