# Repl.it-2020
This is the project for the end of the year. We will give the highlights of repl.it in this website, and we will also give a thank you note to repl.

## Org
If you are viewing this from repl.it, make sure you are in the GitHub organization. Go [here](https://github.com/Repl-it-Coders) and press view invitation and accept it. One thing to note is that when you join it says I can see your IP address. I asked the GitHub community if it is possible to remove this IP address visibility thing and where the IP addresses are, but the person said you cannot remove the IP address thing. Go [here](https://github.community/t/organization-ip/149521/2) to see it. The only thing is, that person said the IP addresses would be in the audit log. I went and checked there, but all I could see was the countries. I think that person was mistaken or whatever but I promise you I can't find your IP addresses anywhere. The only thing you have to be cautious about is that I can see your country. Please believe me, as you can even see here: ![An image of sorts](https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1608214875670_48ca30c593dedc87ec4f55cf3a9f3c77.png)
