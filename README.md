# Intro
This is a project for replit. In 2020 we went through many hardships but replit has still helped us through this year, and, for that, we should thank replit.

## Project
This is a simple project me and my team members in the [Repl-it-Coders Org](https://github.com/Repl-it-Coders) created. It is a website with a thank you note to replit, a page for the best posts of the year, and a timeline of all the announcements of the year. We also wanted to have a suggestions page system but we couldn't make it in time and I couldn't figure out how to do it. The suggestions page will still be there in the link https://replit-2020.whippingdot.repl.co/suggestions but it won't be there in the nav bar. This is because, if anyone can, I still want to finish the suggestions and make it work. If you want to give a suggestion for now on replit create a comment to this post and say your suggestion, but if you want to give a suggestion on GitHub create an issue. If you want to be added to the GitHub Org, comment down below or create an issue, and if you want to help with finishing the suggestions page, comment down below or create an issue. One thing to note is that these suggestions are for replit, not for this website, but if you want you can also give suggestions on this website.

## Contributions

[Me(Whippingdot)](https://replit.com/@Whippingdot): I did most CSS(except hard parts) and I did a lot of the typing on pages, hence the 'I's on some pages.
