# Hi
This is a project for repl.it. In 2020 we went through many hardships but repl.it has still helped us through this year. We are still here, and we survived 2020, and we should thank repl.it for that.

## Project
This is a simple website in which we will say thanks to repl, we will have a suggestions box, and we will have a timeline of what happened in repl.it. We will also have the best posts of the year in the posts section. This will be based on the most upvoted posts in the year. We will have the most upvoted posts, feedback, and bugs of the year in the posts section.

## GitHub
If you are here, that means you are either in the GitHub org or I have invited you to the GitHub org. If you haven't joined the GitHub organization then go [here](https://github.com/Repl-it-Coders) and press view invitation and join. One thing to note is that it says I can see you IP address. I have asked in the GitHub community if you can disable this thing but the person responded with no. He also said the IP addresses are in the audit log, but when I checked there, the only thing I could see is the countries. Please believe me, as I promise that I can only see your country, and that I cannot see your IP address. You can look at the GitHub post I made earlier and you can look at other posts and you will see that I am not lying.
