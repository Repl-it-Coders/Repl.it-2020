# Intro
This is a project for repl.it. In 2020 we went through many hardships but repl.it has still helped us through this year, and, for that, we should thank repl.it.

## Project
This is a simple project me and my team members in the [Repl-it-Coders Org](https://github.com/Repl-it-Coders) created. It is a website with a thank you note to repl.it, a page for the best posts of the year, and a timeline of all the announcements of the year. We also wanted to have a suggestions page system but we couldn't make it in time and I couldn't figure out how to do it. The suggestions page will still be there in this [link](https://replit-2020.whippingdot.repl.co/suggestions) but it won't be there in the nav bar. This is because, if anyone can, I still want to finish the suggestions and make it work. If you want to give a suggestion for now on repl.it create a comment to this post and say your suggestion, but if you want to give a suggestion on GitHub create an issue. If you want to be added to the GitHub Org, comment down below or create an issue, and if you want to help with finishing the suggestions page, comment down below or create an issue. One thing to note is that these suggestions are for repl.it, not for this website, but if you want you can also give suggestions on this website.

## Contributions
From the [Repl-it-Coders Org](https://github.com/Repl-it-Coders) the people who contributed to this project are:
- [Me (Whippingdot)](https://repl.it/@Whippingdot): I did most CSS(except hard parts) and I did a lot of the typing on pages, hence the 'I's on some pages.
- [isaiah08](https://repl.it/@isaiah08): He helped with the nodejs at the start and he and me planned the whole project out.
- [ColePete](https://repl.it/@ColePete): He helped with creating all the initial files and finding the bugs in the project.
- [SixBeeps](https://repl.it/@SixBeeps): He/She helped with fixing the bug where linking to the CSS file would not work. This was a huge problem and I thank SixBeeps for fixing this.
- [Coder100](https://repl.it/@Coder100): He created his .eslintrc.js file in this project. I don't know what it does but he still did something which I think helped the project.
- [TsunamiOrSumth](https://repl.it/@TsunamiOrSumth): He created the favicon for our GitHub org and for all our websites. He did some photoshopping and brought us this [awesome favicon](https://repl.it/@Whippingdot/Replit-2020/#replfavicon.png).
- [BD103](https://repl.it/@BD103): He did some touching up to the code, and restyled the website. ~~He deleted a lot of my CSS and added his own. It is ok he did this but I hope next time he asks me.~~ ~~I, BD103, will ask you next time. Also, I created another style UwU that you should like better. It has less purple, more fonts, and some animations. :P~~
