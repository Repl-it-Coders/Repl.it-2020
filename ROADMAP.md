# Roadmap

## In progress
- [ ] Make nav bar right underneath the 2021 sign and make it in the center(both are the same thing)
- [ ] Finish the timeline(timeline is on the home page and it is about announcements of the year. Announcements found in repl talk)
- [ ] Make the Suggestions work. One person create an email and tick mark this when you create it. Put the email in a .env file with the password. The email should be ReplitCoders@whatever.whatever and the password should be ReplitCoders. Later I will delete the .env file so only a few people know what the password is. If the .env file is created and a password is put, do not push the changes to GitHub. After creating the email, try to make the program send an email to the email created. If no-one can do that, then if you have a simpler idea, try implementing that. We can't just post the suggestions in the console because I don't think everyone will be sitting on the console all day.
  - [ ] Make the boxes and the suggestions submit button look better.
- [X] Finish the most upvoted posts
  - [ ] Make the most upvoted posts look better
- [ ] Submit project on New Year
- [ ] One week after submit a post with all the suggestions, with the most wanted first, and the least wanted last. Only valid suggetsions allowed.

## Finished
