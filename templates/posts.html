    <h3 class="center">A note</h3>
    <p class="center">This year was a sad year as we had many crises, but one thing to note is that because of Covid-19, repl.it gained many members to their community. Many people were bored cooped up inside and so they started coding. They found repl.it, and started using it as their IDE. People who were coding before too started coding even more and as a result this year we had many good projects shared on repl talk. I am saying this as when I was looking at the most upvoted posts this year, I found out that the number 6th most upvoted post ever was a post from this year. Even number 7 was and many more. All the top 10 most upvoted posts of this year were in the top 30 of the most upvoted posts of all time(with the 10th most upvoted being number 28). Thank you, repl.it community, for creating these awesome posts and thank you, repl.it creators, for making this awesome website. You, <a href="https://repl.it/@amasad">amasad</a>, and you, <a href="https://repl.it/@hayaodeh">hayaodeh</a>, are simply the best!!!</p>
