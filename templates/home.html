    <h1 class="center">Wow, we made it to 2021!</h1>
    <p class="center">We have a few things that helped us achieve this accomplishment. One of those things was Repl.it for pushing people onward in this time of COVID with cool code challenges and other things like colaborations and sponserships on cool code programs like AOC. We've highlighted the best stuff from this year, and added a <a class="homeLink" href="/suggestions">suggestions page </a> in this website so we can give our feedback to repl.it. Thanks!</p>
